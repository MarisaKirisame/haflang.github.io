      <h2>Project goals</h2>
      <p> By implementing functional languages in FPGA hardware,
        this project aims to increase throughput to shorten runtimes
        and reduce energy use compared with CPUs. Our objectives
        are:</p>
      <ul class="icon-list">
        <li>Remove layers of compiler-based indirection in software
          based functional languages by designing a soft processor that better
          matches the graph reduction model.</li>
        <li>Investigate hardware memory hierarchy design for
          non-strict functional languages.</li>
        <li>Develop graph reduction innovations in hardware, such as
          garbage collection "close to" intelligent memory units.</li>
        <li>Discover the kinds of applications best suited for
          hardware acceleration of graph reduction.</li>
      </ul>
